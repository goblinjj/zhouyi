package-lock.json
# (Optional: keep package-lock.json if you want deterministic builds, 
# but for simple personal projects sometimes it's excluded. 
# Standard practice is to KEEP it. I will NOT exclude it by default. 
# But user might want to exclude it if they didn't commit it yet.
# User `git push` showed 47 objects. `node_modules` is usually large.
# If `node_modules` was already committed, .gitignore won't remove it from repo without `git rm --cached`.
# I will add standard ignores.)
